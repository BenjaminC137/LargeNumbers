      <h2>Things to Consider</h2>
      <p>
        No human can comprehend 8 billion people. When you hear things in the news, it is important to consider how many
        people are alive and the percentage of people that are affected by any given issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's the largest number you can visualize, comprehend or use in mental simulations and thought experiments?
        <br>
        1000?
        <br>
        100?

        Let's try a few examples. Let's start easy.
        * Picture 10 apples. Can you hold them all in your hands at the same time? My guess is that most people can.
        What
        about 20 apples? 100? How many can you hold at once?
        * 100. We should all know that, fairly well. Try to visualize 100 grains of rice. What would that look like?
        * Experiment. Scoop ou 1000 grains of sand or something more regularly sized.




        Make a YouTube channel asking people these questions and having them try things like holding 20 apples or
        estimating
        amounts of sand.

        Make an app that asks these questions and then generates a report on accuracy with bars that are either
        partially
        or
        over filled.

        * Stars in the Milky Way
        * How fast does light travel?
        * How far does light travel in a millisecond (1/1000 of 1 second)
        * Atoms in a human body
        * 8 billion people:
        * How many people would make a reasonable sample size for the global population?
        * If 100 people opened a new bag of skittles, and all found an m&m amongst the skittles, what percentage of bags
        of skittles did this happen to?
        * Is it worth even considering?
        * If you send a message from your phone to a friend, and the message fails, what percentage of messages you've
        sent have failed? Basically, how many texts have you sent, and how many have failed. What's the percentage? Is
        it
        meaningful?
        * How many physical devices and wires and wireless jumps are made when you send one text message?
        * What's percentage if the global population is 80,000,000 people's? 1%.
        * When you watch the news and see that something bad has happened, how many people would this have to happen to
        in
        order to be concerned that it could happen to you? How many people would it have to happen to in order for you
        to
        change any behavior in your life to avoid or protect against it? Let's say, phone battery bursting, murders,
        school
        shootings, plane crash, etc.
